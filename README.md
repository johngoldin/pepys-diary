### Text processing on Pepys Diary
This Shiny-based project provides for a serches of The Diary of Samuel Pepys.

The folder `Search_Pepys` contains a [Shiny app that will search Pepys Diary](https://goldin.shinyapps.io/Search_Pepys/). It has been published to the `shinyapps.io` server.

Each morning I read an entry from [The Diary of Samuel Pepys](http://www.pepysdiary.com/) at a wonderful site created by [Phil Gyford](http://www.gyford.com/. Pepys kept the diary for about ten years during the 1660â€™s. Inspired by a post by [Julia Silge](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Life-Changing-Magic/), I did some simple text processing on the diary. That became the occasion for my first shot at creating a Shiny app.
