## Text processing on Pepys Diary
This Shiny-based project provides for a serches of The Diary of Samuel Pepys.

Right now this project is doing double duty. I am new to Git and Github and this is the first project that I have synced with Github. As a result, this will display a bit of floundering around.
Perhaps once I have github under control, I will turn this into a more appropriate ReadMe.
