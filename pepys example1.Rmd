```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I have extracted the text for the Diary of Samuel Pepys (Wheatley edition) from Project Guttenberg and 
written some code that can extract particular words or phrases. 

For example, here are the first 50 mentions of the Duke of York:

```{r cars, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
library(plyr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringi)
library(stringr)
library(tidytext)
library(devtools)
load("entry_df.RData")
source("word_in_context.R")
word_in_context(entry_df, "Duke of York", max_entries = 40)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
